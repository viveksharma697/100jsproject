        // or use the new ES6 spread
        const play4 = [...babies]

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // the same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Ssdd Vor',
            age: 12

        // and think we make a copy;
        // const captain = person;
        // captain.number = 30;

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const captain2 = object.assign({}, person, {number: 30});
        console.log(captain2);

        // we will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        // const captain3 = {...person};
